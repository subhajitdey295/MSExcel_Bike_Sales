➡️ Situation:
✅ This project showcases the development of an interactive Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard in Microsoft Excel to analyze key customer demographics and purchasing trends for a bike sales company. It demonstrates advanced skills in data structuring, pivot table utilization, calculated fields, and dynamic visualization for clear, actionable reporting.

➡️ Task:
✅ The primary goal was to design and implement an interactive dashboard in Excel that would consolidate complex sales data into clear, actionable visual insights. Specifically, the dashboard needed to:
    ⚫ Analyze the relationship between customer age (Adolescent, Middle Age, Old) and their decision to purchase a bike.
    ⚫ Evaluate the correlation between customer commute distance and the bike purchase decision.
    ⚫ Identify the Average Income per Purchase broken down by Marital Status and Gender.
    
➡️ Action:
✅ Data Structuring and Cleaning: Utilized Excel's data manipulation tools to clean, standardize, and structure the raw sales data.
✅ Pivot Table Creation: Developed multiple Pivot Tables on a dedicated 'Pivot Table' sheet to aggregate data by key metrics (Age Bracket, Commute Distance, Income, Marital Status, Gender).
✅ Advanced Formula Implementation: Employed advanced logical functions (e.g., IF, IFS) on the 'Working Sheet' to categorize continuous data (like age and income) into discrete buckets (e.g., "Adolescent," "Middle Age," "Old"). For example, an IFS function was used to create the Age Bracket column.
✅ Dashboard Design and Visualization: Constructed the 'Dashboard' sheet, creating and formatting three primary charts to visually represent the Pivot Table data:
    ⚫ Customer Age Brackets: A line chart was used to compare purchase rates across age groups.
    ⚫ Customer Commute: A line chart was used to compare purchase rates across commute distance segments.
    ⚫ Average Income per Purchase: A clustered column chart was used to display income averages by gender and marital status.
✅ Interactivity: Integrated Slicers (as seen for Marital Status, Region, and Education) and Timeline Filters to allow end-users to dynamically filter all visualizations, making the dashboard interactive and user-friendly.

➡️ Result:
✅ The completed Excel Bike Sales Dashboard provided the sales and marketing teams with immediate, dynamic, and actionable insights, resulting in:
    ⚫ Clearer Targeting: Easily identified the Middle Age group as the highest propensity to buy, allowing for focused marketing spend. 
    ⚫ Strategic Product Placement: Revealed sales trends related to commute distance, informing inventory decisions on bikes suitable for shorter vs. longer commutes. 
    ⚫ Improved Efficiency: Reduced the time spent on manual data analysis from hours to seconds through the use of slicers and dynamic visualizations.
    ⚫ High-Impact Deliverable: Successfully delivered a professional, functional, and visually appealing BI tool that became the standard for monthly sales performance reviews.
